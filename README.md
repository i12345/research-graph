# Graphical thoughts

To edit and view thought thoughts in a graphical rather than linear format, could simplify working with complex topics and exploring subjects with the verse view points.

Central actions include writing, selection, noting for research, considering related information. Research graph facilitates this by having information in one place rather than distributed through separate documents. Like AI chat, but, it's able to respond to user input and answer questions, the unlike a chatbot, it's not limited to a linear conversation.

To start with, a graph database stores information. Text, images, files, etc. Images are just a kind of file. Text documents can have an associated audio recording that they were transcribed from. Otherwise, any text document can be synthesized into speech. This describes the graph database like an arbitrary storage of items, though other database providers could be connected.

when an item is selected, item type specific options may appear for it (for example for text, there is a button to play the text) though for all items there is the option to ask a question/make a relationship starting from the item. Questions are suggested to ask, and the user can also type in their own question. When they select a question, a new relationship has made from the first item to a new item  , and the user can also type in their own question. When they select a question, a new relationship has made from the first item to a new item with the question labeling the directed relationship between them. The relationship has a full prompt, though a summary of the relation is the label for the arrow/path.

Voice input is a very useful way to work with a graph. Because the graph model makes a neighborhood for the notes currently focused on/visible to the user, user request to select a different note or search for other notes are easy to interpret. This will let the user have hands-free interaction with their diagrams. They can also ask questions and receive answers about their diagrams. With the research AI assistant working simultaneously, a conversation with the graph could have more flexibility than a conversation with a regular chatbot.

The graph model naturally makes related notes closer together. Though the user can specify custom visual layouts, including vertical and horizontal stacks and tables. The tables can impose a filter on items within their cells. Relationships can be presented in two forms: a directed arrow/path, or just an arrowhead with the label/relation above the destination note.

Nodes can be referenced by hyperlink, and hyperlink can appear within texts, because they are markdown.

Selection notes are based from a source note. Updating the selection note content updates the corresponding content in the source note and vice versa. When a range of text is selected in a text note, an option appears to make an excerpt/selection note from that currently selected range.
